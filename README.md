# FABAMAQ-TEST
A shooting gallery game with credits system using wxWidgets

This was a practice project to learn how to create programs with a GUI, in this case wxWidgets.
Although in my previous internship the team worked with wxWidgets, we had an outdated version. So I decided to practice using the newer version of wxWidgets.

The project is designed to imitate an old arcade machine system with the intent of adding a casino machine type of payouts.SO in order to pay you have to insert credits. Once done the objective is to hit as many squares with the target color in 60 seconds. The patterns of the game are predetermined and the board changes every 5 seconds. 
After the time runs out the total credits received are calculated based on the player's score. If the score is between 30 to 50 points, they receive 1 coin. If it's above 50 points they receive coins equal to the score. They can play another round or cash out with the credits.
The game also tracks the number of times played and how many credits are inserted, retrieved or stored.
